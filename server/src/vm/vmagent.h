/* vmagent.h — org.lordos.agent, Machines' own channel into a guest (docs/VIRTUALIZATION.md 6.8, 6.17, 7.1.1), and
 * the bits lord-vm needs to talk to qemu-guest-agent.
 *
 * A virtio-serial port named org.lordos.agent: no network, no port, no VNC; lordos-guest (tools/guest) holds the guest's
 * end as the person signed in at the guest's display. Frames, both ways:
 *
 *   u32 length (little endian, of the payload)  u16 kind  u16 channel  payload
 *
 * At most AG_FRAME_MAX bytes of payload; anything longer, or a stream that doesn't parse, is dropped whole (the guest
 * is untrusted: lord-vm parses this inside its own sandbox, never lord-server). Kinds a side doesn't know are skipped,
 * so either side can grow.
 *   AGK_HELLO  guest → host  "lordos-guest <version> <capability>…" (text); the host answers with its own hello
 *   AGK_CLIP   both ways     the clipboard's text, UTF-8; only in the directions the machine allows (machine.json)
 * The host never asks the guest to run anything over this channel, and the guest can't ask the host for anything. */
